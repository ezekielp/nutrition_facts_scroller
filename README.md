## <a name="background"></a> Background

This project will be a scroller with data visualizations about nutrition facts of staple foods. It will emphasize lesser-known facts about well-known food items (and a few that are commonly neglected). The scroller format and hover effects on the visualizations will provide interactivity, and the order of the visualizations will serve to compare and contrast the properties of various foods.

## <a name="functionality"></a> Functionality & MVP

Users of the nutrition facts scroller will be able to:

- [ ] Scroll through the visualizations (minimum of 10 slides)
- [ ] Hover over each of the charts to see additional information
- [ ] Toggle between the various featured foods on the last slide

Additionally, this project will include:

- [ ] A sidebar of scrollable text providing some context and highlights about the food featured in a given visualization
- [ ] A production README
